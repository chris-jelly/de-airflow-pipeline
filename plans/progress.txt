# Ralph Progress Log
## Codebase Patterns
- Scripts in `k3d/scripts/` should use `#!/bin/bash` and `set -e`.
- Version checks can use `sort -V` for semantic versioning comparison.

## 2026-01-31 - US-001
- Implemented `k3d/scripts/toolchain-validate.sh` to check for k3d, kubectl, helm.
- Validated versions and existence of `k3d/cluster-config.yaml`.
- Files changed: `k3d/scripts/toolchain-validate.sh`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - `k3d/cluster-config.yaml` already exists with a full configuration.
  - `k3d` directory contains manifests and scripts for the local environment.
