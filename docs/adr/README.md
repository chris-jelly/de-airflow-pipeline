## About ADRs

Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) are documents that capture important architectural decisions made during the development of this project. Each ADR describes the context, decision, and consequences of a particular choice.

### ADR Format

Each ADR follows this structure:
- **Status**: Current status (Proposed, Accepted, Deprecated, Superseded)
- **Context**: The situation that prompted this decision
- **Decision**: The choice that was made
- **Consequences**: The results of this decision (positive and negative)

### Creating a New ADR

1. Create a new file with format `XXX-title.md` where XXX is the next number
2. Follow the established format and include all required sections
3. Update this README.md index with the new ADR
4. Commit both files together
